## Brief Description: 

Wazobia Real Estate Limited is a prominent real estate company operating in Nigeria. With a vast portfolio of properties, they strive to provide accurate and competitive pricing for houses. However, they have been facing challenges in accurately predicting the prices of houses in the current market. To overcome this hurdle, Wazobia Real Estate Limited is seeking the expertise of data scientists like you to develop a robust predictive model.

The objective of this hackathon is to create a powerful and accurate predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in Nigeria. By leveraging the provided dataset, you will analyze various factors that impact house prices, identify meaningful patterns, and build a model that can generate reliable price predictions. The ultimate goal is to provide Wazobia Real Estate Limited with an effective tool to make informed pricing decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market. The challenge is part of the [Zindi Competetion](https://zindi.africa/competitions/free-ai-classes-in-every-city-hackathon-2023).

### Data Explorations

The chart above shows that the six regions exhibit approximately equal proportions of houses. This suggests that all regions hold a significant share of the housing market. Such balanced distribution indicates that housing opportunities are fairly distributed across the area, presenting a positive outlook for potential homebuyers.

From the figure above, the two regions with the highest average house prices are Southwest and South-South. Houses in these regions are generally more expensive compared to other areas. The premium pricing in these regions may be attributed to factors such as proximity to amenities, renowned schools, or desirable neighborhood characteristics. Homebuyers in search of upscale properties and prime locations may find these regions appealing, albeit at a higher cost.

On the other hand, the regions of Southeast, North-Central, Northeast, and Northwest demonstrate the lowest average house prices among all regions. These areas present more affordable housing options, making them attractive to budget-conscious home buyers seeking cost-effective choices.

The figure above further explains the previous. The box plot presents a clear picture of the distribution of house prices by region. Its symmetrical shape and presence of  outliers across all regions indicate a relatively stable market with high price variability.
