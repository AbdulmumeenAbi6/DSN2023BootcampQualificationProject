## Brief Description: 

Wazobia Real Estate Limited is a prominent real estate company operating in Nigeria. With a vast portfolio of properties, they strive to provide accurate and competitive pricing for houses. However, they have been facing challenges in accurately predicting the prices of houses in the current market. To overcome this hurdle, Wazobia Real Estate Limited is seeking the expertise of data scientists like you to develop a robust predictive model.

The objective of this hackathon is to create a powerful and accurate predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in Nigeria. By leveraging the provided dataset, you will analyze various factors that impact house prices, identify meaningful patterns, and build a model that can generate reliable price predictions. The ultimate goal is to provide Wazobia Real Estate Limited with an effective tool to make informed pricing decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market. The challenge is part of the [Zindi Competetion](https://zindi.africa/competitions/free-ai-classes-in-every-city-hackathon-2023).

The chart above shows that the six regions exhibit approximately equal proportions of houses. This suggests that all regions hold a significant share of the housing market. Such balanced distribution indicates that housing opportunities are fairly distributed across the area, presenting a positive outlook for potential homebuyers.
